# PWA Icons

For a production app, you should replace these placeholder icons with your own branded icons.

You need to create:
1. icon-192x192.png (192×192px)
2. icon-384x384.png (384×384px)
3. icon-512x512.png (512×512px)
4. apple-icon-180.png (180×180px)

To get your app working immediately:
1. Create a simple 512×512 PNG with any design tool
2. Create resized versions at the other dimensions
3. Place them in this folder with the exact filenames listed above
