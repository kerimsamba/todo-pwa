## PWA Features

### Offline Support

This app works offline thanks to service workers that cache assets and local storage for data persistence. Try turning off your internet connection after loading the app to see it in action.

### Installation

You can install this app on your device:

- **On Desktop**: Look for the install icon in your browser's address bar or menu
- **On Mobile**: Use the "Add to Home Screen" option in your browser's menu

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js PWA is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.
